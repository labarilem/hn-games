    "description": "I have now finished 2 years of hard work with an indie game called ZombieRun. Game description: After a massive apocalyptic thunderstorm you find yourself in the middle of a dark graveyard with two hungry zombies drooling over you. It seems that the thunder wasn’t the only thing that hit the world while you were out. Do you want to know what it was? It’s time to act fast, stay alive and get to the city for some answers. That’s where it all begins - it's you, your fast reflexes and guns against all the dead lurking around. The game features classical weapons, gang of living dead and superpowers. Yes, you have SUPERPOWERS! ZombieRun has addictive single player mode and awesome local multiplayer games. Up to 4 players can play at the same time in either single screen co-op mode, where you have to work together as one or split screen competitive mode, where everyone's running for their lives. And also there's the Battle mode where players can blast at each other with what they've got. ZombieRun has controller support, so you can dust off the old joypads. ZombieRun requires a graphics card with OpenGL support and JRE 1.6 or later. Announcement Trailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-vWPXxtevE You can get ZombieRun from http://zombierun.eu All feedback and comments are welcome.",

Without having to read a status update or 140 characters about what people in my network did on the weekend, or how much they love their cat. A content only social network. Like Reddit, people can only share on Verbr when they paste a link (we allow them to add a 60 character caption, to add context to their post). Users each have a Verbr score (Think Reddit Karma) which shows how much people liked their content. As a co-founder, I should probably say that Verbr is a complete game-changer that will revolutionise social media... The truth is that it is not. I do however feel that it is a great product that could provide a much needed service to a lot of people. Feel free to sign up and have a look around. James",

    "description": "Hi Hacker News! My friend and I [1] would like to share with you something we did this week-end. We really like the idea of game jams like the Ludum Dare, and we’d like to participate, but it’s often complicated for us, as we are often limited by the rules inherent to this kind of competition: we have to be available at specific dates, and the rules doesn’t always work for us. For example: if you want to participate as a team in a Ludum Dare compo, you have 72h instead of 48h, and you are not required to publish your code. We realized that what we really like is: - To work together. - The 48h stress (two days is perfect because it fits in a week-end). - To work with a theme. - To play with Open Source enthusiasts, so we can all learn from each other. That’s why we decided to create a quick manifesto, the Selfish Game Challenge [2]. It’s just a really small set of rules that we will follow for our game sessions from now on. It’s really just for us, but we thought it would be nice to share it with people. The game we made is called “REVERSIBLE” [3]. We rushed a bit to finish in time, and it needs a lot of polish, but it feels good to have something playable at the end. It’s about cells and evolution, and we quite like it! It’s open source, so don’t hesitate to have a look at the repository too [4].

I liked their concept and taught of presenting it to HN Readers before they launch: They have made totally different and 3D version of traditional Snakes & Ladders game. In this game instead of traditional flat board, player needs to climb a 3D tower. On way he will face snakes and ladders at different steps. You can have the first look of our game here: \nhttps://www.behance.net/wip/577365/1060829 And after having the look of it if you felt like its interesting then PM me your email id I will send you the android apk (pre-launch) of the same.

With our previous game Quento (quento.com) we tried a slick, minimal game that focuses on challenging puzzles. But it was still quite obvious that you were doing math because you had to use operators to complete sums. With Numolition we tried a different strategy by using cute artwork and investing more time in creating a theme around the core gameplay that makes the game look more like \"real\" games. You're still doing math, but you're less aware of it. Kind of like a trojan horse ;-) We hope kids and adults alike will enjoy the challenging puzzles while improving their math skills at the same time :) Have a go, introduce it to the kids in your life, and let us know how it went! Thanks, the Numolition team",

This was influenced by how playlists are tagged on 8tracks, and how game levels are tagged in LittleBigPlanet. We threw something functional together, and would like to get some feedback on the idea/site. It allows anyone to tag movies with a variety of adjectives, and for a user to search by them. This sort of tagging would allow us to find movies that are alike, a user to track which types of movies he/she likes, and offer a recommendation system based on the data. http://flickseeker.com",

One of them is your human opponent, but you don’t know who he is. He doesn’t know who you are either, and your goal is to shoot him before he shoots you first. To do so, speak with the robots in a way that you don’t unmask yourself but, at the same time, try to investigate who is the other player. I'd like to know what do you think about it. Thank you.",

    "description": "http://www.terraexgame.com Terra Ex will be a 4x (\"explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate\") multiplayer online browser based game. Our Kickstarter will begin Oct. 16th (link to KS preview is on our site). We are making this game, in part, to fund STEM education. Details are on our site. About the game (from the site): \n\"Our story begins eons from now, when Earth collides with Mars. Humanity must face an uncertain future: we must forge new civilizations in the far corners of space. Your ships are small at first, but opportunity is endless. Will you become a merchant society or focus on espionage? Do you seek to dominate the universe or live peacefully among other races? Once you branch out into the galaxy, you'll have the opportunity to work with or fight against other players. You can build up your weapons or search for planets rich in minerals.\"The stack is: PHP, MySQL, Memcache+APC, nginx, JQuery, SOLR, CloudFlare, our in-house Javascript+PHP framework, hosted at DigitalOcean. We added an \"Easter egg\" on the site where you can click the starports on either side of the \"ACTNOW!\" button to launch fighters. And once launched, you can click them to shoot them down. Have fun! :) Thanks!",

    "description": "Hello Hacker News! One of the common questions we get from people is how we spend our time in our twelve week apprenticeship cohorts.  While we have many labs and sample projects available to our apprentices, the best learning experiences are found by creating \"breakable toys\": applications that the apprentices choose that are aligned with their interests. Our current cohort has several members who have fallen in love with the card game Dominion, and so we decided it would be interesting to build an application together to keep track of the dozens of card types for browsing and create a random card picker since you only play with ten types in a single game. Several of the apprentices challenged me to go back and create some screen casts of how we went through the process and share it out so that potential applicants can get a glimpse into what our apprentices are capable of after 7-8 weeks of training.  I agreed, and have started production on these videos. Whether you are an experienced developer who wants to see what C#, ASP.NET MVC4, and SQL Server bring to the table or a beginner who wants to see what it's like to build a minimum viable product, feel free to join us on our YouTube channel.  The first set of videos is published, and the rest of the series is coming soon! http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg6qLo5I5vnWGjWE-MjP1t_zzfAmKeTBa",

Based on the feedback we received we made a new trailer video. I think this one does a better job of showing GamePress and its features.\nVideo can be seen at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZUNhviJLr8 or at www.gamepressapp.com\nJust a quick reminder of what GamePress is:\nGamePress  lets you create, share and play mobile games right on the iPad. With our robust behaviour system you can create a wide range of genres, so theres really no limit to your imagination. Some features include:\nEasy to use level editor so you can easily build your worlds and place objects Behaviour editor which replaces programming. Works like a flowchart of actions and events Complete physics engine (powered by Box2D) Particle Editor so you can quickly whip up some awesome particles Sound Effects creator so you can make some custom sound effects Thousands of included art assets to get you started on making your games Ability to import your own graphics, music, or sound effects Special effects like shaders, and tweening. Look forward to hearing your feedback on the concept and the new video.\nGamePress will be released around the end of April.",

It doesn't look as 'pretty' since it relies on CSS3 to pretty it up a bit. But it's pretty light weight. It was my first foray into Javascript prototypes, and while I'm sure there are bugs, although I haven't encountered any game breaking ones myself.

A lot of after work and weekend hours have been pooring into the project since then, and I think it's about time to show the progress What's been done: - Preloading\n- Completely rewrote layout for desktop / tablet browsers using css3 :target.\n- Usage instructions added \n(one of the comments I got: \"Yeah, it works, but how do I play?\" )\n- Sending all powerups to other users now works\n(click on another user's playfield to send powerup)\n- Game over implemented serverside so a mulitplayer game can end. \n- Now works on tablets with touch input.\nswipe left/right/down for controls, tap another user's playfield for sending powerup. \nTap the powerups bar to apply to self.\n\nWhat's todo: - Fix some last bugs in the tetris engine \n( Blocks can still move up in rare cases,\nT-Spins don't always work in all directions )\n- Global online highscores\n- 2 player mode with an direct invite url\n- Finishing touches, Package the app, and deploy!\n- Phone UI in the works\n\nPlease come and play and try to overload my little gameserver.

    "description": "About a year ago me and a buddy joined Google's HTML5GameJam, a game building hackathon. Finally I've had the time to dust the project off, upgrade some of the required libraries (node.js bumped from 0.4.2 to 0.8.11 in the meantime) and did some minor patching to get it done for some finishing touches and hopefully release somewhere this year. We implemented the full real Tetris® (yeah, that means T-Spins and funky stuff Tetris addicts like) in MVC, with configurable renderers (canvas, ASCII, Divs), input methods (keyboard, swipe, touch), 2player split mode and offline singeplayer. The multiplayer support is inspired by Tetrinet  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TetriNET ), powerups are all implemented but it's not yet possible to bomb one of your opponents. I have no clue how the (self-hosted) hacked up node.js game server will perform , and there's no game rooms yet, but the basics work. Please have a look, comments, suggestions and inspiration would be appreciated.\nHow should we do the touch input for instance? I'd like it if I can be as good a Tetris player on my mobile as in the browser with the keyboard.",

So I built a habit-tracker which plays like an RPG. As you accomplish goals, you level up. If you fail your goals, you lose hit points. You can buy weapons and armor, etc. Open source (https://github.com/lefnire/habitrpg), built on DerbyJS (http://derbyjs.com/), and uses BrowserQuest's icon sets. Integration with productivity tools primary on the roadmap (https://github.com/lefnire/habitrpg#roadmap). I stress-tested some, but Derby is a work in progress - so bear with me if it goes down.",

    "description": "Hey, it's been a long time in the making, but we're finally ready with our public BETA version of our Android application. We're anxiously (and nervously) awaiting your feedback, so please lay it on us. Our biggest fear is hearing nothing. The game is called Super Tic Tac Toe. It's a new take on the old, boring tic tac toe that more often than not ended in a cat's game. The game board is a large tic tac toe board with each square comprised of a smaller tic tac toe board. You and an opponent place your marks on the smaller boards, each move dictating where your opponent may move next (and vice versa), to achieve victory on the larger board. You can Connect With Facebook, but if you'd rather not, you can create a normal account in our system. You can add and play any of the developers / founders (usernames: nuri, Gootz, QippArgent) or invite your friends and play against them!\nPlease, check out the application and leave us your feedback! You can leave a comment here and myself or QippArgent will try to respond as soon as possible, and feel free to send either one of us a private message as well. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cannygroup.superttt http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UGTWHg_wUM",

    "name": "My weekend project, Flair -- Like a friendly reverse Pinterest thingy",
    "description": "Hey all, just wanted to invite you to take a spin on this project I've been working on recently. To give you a bit of context, I'm a Pinterest/Tumblr/Svpply user but found that it's all still sub-optimal. The experience of these, I guess 'social' things, is still always about \"me, me, me\": Pin things I like, post items I like, I want this and that etc. My point is, in my experience, this got boring relatively quickly. Plus, when I log in to Pinterest for example, it's this wall of sound of relatively (albeit nice looking) yet random things. Anyways, a few weeks back, my roommate happened to have a bunch of her close friends over for a clothing-swap. Basically, everyone brings a bunch of clothes she doesn't wear any(more) and swaps it with someone in the room. This is how it went down: One would pull out, say a skirt, and show it to the group. Within seconds - and I found this remarkable - the groupmind decided who should try it on. In 9 out of 10 cases this was an accurate assessment and the item was swapped, tried on and (with some Madonna playing in the background) presented to the group. All smiles all around :) So, this got me thinking how important friends are for filtering out the noise and how strong their recommendation is. It's that moment, when a friend sees something in a store and says `This is so you!'. Based on these two observations, I came up with what would become Flair. A game where friends find great things FOR each other. What's there now is a bare-bones site ready for (in)validation. Note, that overall, this game is targeted towards women who are already using Pinterest, but I figured I'd show it to you anyways. Here's what I invite you to do: 1. Think of a close friend and what you like doing/thinking/talking about together 2. Hop over to http://letsflair.com, check out the site 3. Unless you're averse to it, log in through Facebook (if you are, please don't bother commenting on it) 4. Start your Spree with your friend 5. Go and find awesome stuff for them! There is a bookmarklet I highly recommend installing, it makes the process of adding stuff super simple. tldr; Got bored with Pinterest, saw how friends are really good at recommending things to each other, built a game called Flair (http://letsflair.com) that mixes the two (and is actually a lot of fun)",

    "description": "We started this flight simulator about 2 years ago to be PC based, after realizing that it was too big of a task, we switched to Windows Phone 7 (Release Apr 2011) and recently released on iOS (March 2012). So far, the reviews have been encouraging, and we're closing in on our second update. Last update brought iPad3 support, new airplanes and bug fixes. Next one will bring 2 additional aircrafts, missions, better map, IFR Fixes/Airways... Now, for the things that the HN crowd might be interested in: - It's entirely in C#. Codebase of the simulator itself (excluding XNA, MonoGame) is 99% shared between WP7 and iOS. - The user base on iOS is much larger than on WP7, the numbers go far beyond our wildest expectations. (It's a bit early to tell, but something like 30x to 45x what we had on Windows Phone so far) - The physics engine is custom, we're using rigid body simulation and apply forces based on angle of attack, airspeed, lift tables... - Using MonoGame/MonoTouch has been incredible, the guys at Xamarin are great! - We did run into issues with Garbage Collection, but nothing that we couldn't solve with a classic optimization session at the end - People seem to love the fact that we setup a uservoice site. (http://feedback.flyingdevstudio.com). We've got tons of suggestions and we'll try to implement what people want first.

I have promised myself to post a Show HN thread with some cool work and this is our first attempt. Deployment wise I am having some difficulties in setting up server. I think we'd have problem scaling it up. If any Nepali hacker is interested to support us technically I'd love to get in touch. My email is in HN profile. Please connect.

When you register, you get your own \"table\" page, which is a kind of persistent chatroom where you can GM games.  The miniatures, dice, battlemat, and chat system are all built in. The default ruleset (d6 dice pool + trait-based characters) is intended for quick, mostly freeform games.  This sidesteps many of the common problems with chat-based gaming, and should make it easier for players to join any game posted on the site. I'd appreciate any feedback. Thanks! http://fabletop.com",

You can get it at www.walkbase.com With Walkbase, app developers can push location-specific room-level context (e.g. in-game content, coupons, mobile ads) to various smartphone apps. The idea is to give you a logical context (e.g Starbucks, SOMA) rather than an approximate GPS position for your users and we hope devs will be able to build a bunch of cool stuff on top of this. We hope you like it and find it useful. Feedback is of course very welcome!",

    "description": "So the story is that i was playing fillr(http://fillrgame.com/index.html) on my phone and kept winning even on hardest levels, so I thought either my strategy is way too good or the computer is not smart enough. Either way I wanted to make an algorithm that could always win. What I have is done in less than an hour and not as smart as it can be. So let's make it smart :) Rules of the game:\n* Game consists of colored blocks. You start at top left, computer starts at bottom left, both with initial 1 block. Every time you change your color all the blocks with this new color that have an edge with your previously owned blocks become yours.\n* Game goes on until all blocks have been assigned.\n* You can't change to your opponents color\n* You HAVE to change your color on your turn Rules for computer:\nCan only look into 1 step in the future. Web: http://sasangootik.com/fillr/\nCompVs.Comp: http://sasangootik.com/fillr/#auto Git: https://github.com/shezarkhani/fillr.js I have included 2 algorithms (very similar) and 1 I am working on which is already smarter than both. [Code is ugly and NOT optimized at all.]",

The Reddit thread can be found here: http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/j5bl3/can_whoever_makes_browsers_please_consider_adding/ The extension itself is located here:\nhttp://www.mutetab.com/ Basically, my project is a Chrome extension that attempts to provide browser-wide sound management to the extent possible within an extension.  It helps a user find what is making sound by identifying what is possibly making sound, allows automatically muting background sounds, and provides a context menu with sound management commands that will use JavaScript where available and otherwise hides elements from the page. It does not solve the more general \"mute tab\" problem -- if a plugin instance doesn't have a JavaScript API, then the only way I can mute it is by hiding it from the page (like Flashblock does).  This is unideal because if it is a game or a video, hiding and reshowing it will restart it. I'm most interested in getting technical feedback (please read the FAQ since I mention some ideas that I haven't heard anyone discuss) but am also interested in feedback about how I am presenting things (what I'm doing might be too complicated for many users to understand) and general feedback.",

    "description": "This was my recent weekend project, aimed at teaching me JavaScript, a bit of HTML5, and (mostly) WebGL. The orbital data are from NASA JPL. I was inspired in part by this Flash app: http://www.dynamicdiagrams.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/orrery_2011_bce.swf, but wanted to do something in 3D. Coming from the games-dev world, this is my first introduction to web coding. The UI is jquery. I mostly used http://learningwebgl.com/blog for the 3D stuff. Being WebGL, it will work mostly on Chrome, Firefox 4 Beta. Forget about IE. I needed to figure out how to render text to the WebGL canvas - I won't say I have the perfect solution, but the general approach is to use a conventional HTML5 canvas, then copy it once per frame into a WebGL texture. There's something funky going on in this process - the textures get corrupted, and resizing the window leads to slowdown. For the future I'd like to make the planets clickable and zoomable, maybe put in a search box to zoom to objects of interest. I'd like to build it up to a full catalogue of the Solar System - comets, the larger asteroids, dwarf planets - and maybe add the capability to put in known space mission trajectories.",

    "description": "My cofounder and I have been working on a site called Fitocracy (www.fitocracy.com), which is a social game for fitness.  The idea was very much inspired by our experiences growing up as nerds playing video games, later on discovering weightlifting, and drawing the parallel between working out and \"leveling yourself up.\"  XKCD has a pretty well known comic to this effect: http://xkcd.com/189/.  We find that the metaphor of workout out as leveling up in a video game resonates with quite a few people, so Fitocracy is an attempt to bring that to life. On Fitocracy, tracking your workouts earns you points/levels, unlocks special achievements, and fulfills \"quests\", which are basically exercise milestones that aim for workout variety and progression.  As you progress in your training, Fitocracy offers more quests, increases the level up requirements, etc.  We also try to make the experience as community focused as possible, so the site actively encourages you to follow others with similar fitness approaches, comment on workouts, etc. We have been in invite-only beta since mid-February and have become fairly popular on Reddit and SomethingAwful.  I know there are plenty of folks on HN that are interested in fitness so I hope this will be of interest to some of you. URL: http://www.fitocracy.com You can sign up using this invite link:  http://ftcy.co/jaBLMa We're still working through a long list of bugs and features to get out, but do feel free to offer any feedback.  Hope you all enjoy! You can find me on Fitocracy at: http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/xenowang and my cofounder at http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/dicktalens (seriously, the way our usernames may sound to some is purely coincidental) -Brian Interesting side note: We started working on this in October 2010 and I had no real prior experience in front-end design at that point.  I've basically been cutting my teeth in front-end design (design principles, Photoshop mockups, graphic assets, HTML, CSS) on Fitocracy.",

    "name": "I emailed video game companies about breaking into the industry",
    "description": "A few years ago, I emailed a few prominent video game companies (Valve, Bethesda, Infinity Ward, and another I have lost the name to). I asked about how one gets a job in the video game industry. Although I'm no longer on that path, I figured the emails might be useful for anyone interested. Cheers: ----- Thanks for your interest and support of Valve.  What does it take to get in to the gaming industry?  I can’t give you a concrete answer, but, after speaking with several of employees, I can offer up these suggestions: 1.       Hone your analytical skills.  As a mental exercise, break down anything around your in life into its base elements.  Try to figure out \"If this were a game, what would the goal be?  What would be my resources?\".  You can break anything down into meaningful quanta.  School, marriage, cars, getting a job...anything could be turned into a game.  It's very important for a game designer to know how and why.  You be the game designer, and you decide. 2.       Build a mod!  The Source SDK gives you the tools that we use to make our games (http://developer.valvesoftware.com).  You can program new monsters, weapons, faces, or design your own levels.  Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat started out using the original Half-Life SDK.  They were both created by people just like you who wanted to show what they could do with cutting-edge technology.  There's no better way to learn how to do a job than by actually doing it, and a mod gives you exactly that opportunity. 3.       Build.  Tinker.  Experiment.  Get a set of creative tools in your hands and put your theories to practice.  Make stuff.  Save it.  Be ready to tell people what you learned from making it. 4.       Don't ignore board games.  Some video gamers don't pay attention to the lessons they teach.  Most if not all of the classic, archetypical game mechanisms can be found in games such as Monopoly, Life, Scrabble, etc.  Not only that, but you can actually play these with your friends that DON’T game – watch what they like about it – observe what makes them want to play again. 5.       Coming up with cool ideas is not the hard part.  Everyone has them, they get you excited, but you’re not going to get rich or famous just because you have an idea for a game.  People are going to listen to you and give you money only when you can actually make the game.  So lower your head, keep those ideas alive, but work, work, work to prove you can make those pie-in-the-sky dreams actually happen. Remember that 99.9% of people who work in videogames are going to spend their whole career making someone else's idea come to life.  If you're not going to be happy with that fact, you may not want to make games. 6. Go to school – any school – not necessarily just places like DigiPen (although it’s a GREAT one).  Learn how to work with OTHER PEOPLE.  This is key – A LOT of different factors, ideas, talent, etc go in to making even the smallest part of a game.  Being able to accept other’s ideas and champion your own, AND do it all with tact, is absolutely essential.  There is no “I” in TEAM – but there is an “M” and an “E” – hmmmm – kidding of course. 7.       Get your name on a shipped product – it speaks volumes.  If you can say \"I crunched with a team in the zero hour to get this software out the door\", then you instantly have the base level of respect that game developers share with one another. 8.       Invest in a good chair – and commit to a workout regimen – you’ll need them both. Keep building, keep learning and most importantly, keep playing. ---- Generally speaking, we look for people who are good at what they do (ie,\nprogramming or art or design) and have some combination of educational\nbackground and work experience, along with examples of work they've done in\ngaming. So, not only do we want good programmers/artists/designers, but we\nwant programmers/artists/designers that have examples of mods or plugins or\ngame-related things they've done on their own that show us they \"get\" what it\nis we do here. There's no magic degree, or school, or number of years of experience\nthat we're necessarily looking for or need. The requirements for each job\nwe're currently hiring for will give you an idea on a position-by-position\nbasis of what kinds of things we look for. They can be found in the Jobs\nsection of www.bethsoft.com I hope that helps. --- I think that most of your questions can be answered here: http://www.infinityward.com/community/forum/index.php?topic=21472.0 It’s an article that one of our Lead Designers wrote about “how to become a designer at IW.” I can tell you that although I think education is very important (it helps you become a wiser and more well rounded person!), not all of our designers have design degrees. What we look for in designers is a strong portfolio of level design and/or scripting that shows detailed levels that are fun to play. We don’t have a specific requirement that design candidates need degrees. Many of our current designers actually came from mod communities. Here’s an article with one of our designers who was a modder before becoming a professional designer for us: http://www.infinityward.com/community/forum/index.php?topic=36293.0 The major benefits of attending a game design school (besides the education) would be the networking opportunities and relationships you could build with other future game designers, as well as internship opportunities. The best design schools have relationships with developers and offer internship programs. Regardless, the bottom line is that in order to get hired at a reputable development studio you need to be able to show design work, and it needs to be good! Level design tools are readily available to download, so there really isn’t anything stopping anyone from learning how to design games on their own, regardless of his/her background or education. Hope that helps. Best of luck! -- Hi there, The best piece of advice we can give is browse game developer websites and start looking at the\nrequirements for game designer positions. Several will be looking for the same kind of\nexperience, and look at what type of programs (like Maya, Photoshop) they like their applicants\nto be proficient in. Knowing such programs (and gaining experience through internships) is the\nmost important. Hope this helps.",

There's no figuring out who to play, and each game is only 90 seconds long. The backend is 2,400 lines (so short!) of Erlang which speaks a custom protocol (length tagged JSON packets) to the client. The Objective-C side protocol implementation makes heavy use of blocks and works a lot like my JavaScript XMPP library. I hope you like it. Please let me know what you think.",

    "description": "I just launched a little weekend project (alright maybe it took two weekends) that I made with my girlfriend. It's a simple iOS game called Punch a Hipster. I wrote all the code, and she drew all the artwork. It was a great opportunity to get her involved in my work and show her what it takes to create and launch an app, as well as to let her experience the excitement of launching a finished product and obsessing over ratings, reviews, etc. Now she has a better understanding of how I feel when I'm completely engrossed in one of my side projects. I highly recommend doing this (or something like it) if you have the opportunity and your significant other has a complementary skill-set, whatever that may be. Our game is here: http://hipsterapp.com What other ways have you involved your significant other in your work?",

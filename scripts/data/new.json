It is more or less exactly what you would expect from the name: An online multiplayer chess game. The code still has a few bugs and is not as pleasant to read as I'd want it to be.. but anyways - it's quite a lot of fun to play! I am actively looking for suggestions. So I'd appreciate any kind of feedback. You can play it on github: http://multichess.github.io",

    "description": "Hey everyone! Long time lurker, first time poster. I've just reached beta in my game BoxByte Lyte. -What is it- It's a free 3d arcade game for hardcore players that uses color matching in interesting ways. Also it's a one button game, well movement and one button. Cool huh? The final release will be free too. -What I need- This is a very challenging game, so I really need to balance the difficulty so that it's still hard but not impossible. It would be great just to hear your experiences of the game and how far in it you got. -Where can I report bugs?- https://bitbucket.org/ZayWolfe/boxbyte-lyte/issues -So where's the game?- Windows: https://www.dropbox.com/s/3143ynz2hlqhg58/BoxByteLyte%2012.17.15-win.zip?dl=0 Mac: https://www.dropbox.com/s/welj1gswunfm4tq/BoxByteLyte%2012.17.15-mac.zip?dl=0 Linux: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ypvtnndmzklj17e/BoxByteLyte%2012.17.15-linux.zip?dl=0 Win VR: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bm0ydtzra4sjml0/BoxByteLyte%2012.17.15-winVR.zip?dl=0\n(Warning VR isn't going to be an official feature. It's just a cool experiment for kicks. Might be nausea inducing. I just think it's cool :3) For the most accurate movement, I recommend playing with a gamepad of some kind. So if hard challenging gameplay is your thing, why don't you see if you have what it takes to beat my game... Mwahahaha! 13 gates, can you reach the end? Cheers!",
